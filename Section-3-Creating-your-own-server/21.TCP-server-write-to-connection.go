// To create an HTTP server that responds to an HTTP request.
// We first create a TCP server. This TCP server will handle the request that come in which are
// formatted in a certain way. As when a request comes in that request is just text.
// So if text is formatted in a certain way, if it is adhering to the HTTP (protocols are rules of communication)
// So if the text that comes in to the TCP server adhere s to the HTTP,
// then our servers will be able to process that text. The standards of a protocl are writtn in RFC-7230
// RFC - Request for comment. It is a document put out by the IETF - Internet engineering Task Force.
